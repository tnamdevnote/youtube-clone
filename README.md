# About

I took on this project <b>without relying on any tutorials for assistance.</b> <br>
I wanted to challenge myself and see if I could recreate some of the features from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) on my own, starting from scratch. By doing so, I not only have the opportunity to learn about areas that I may not be familiar with, but I can also enhance my problem-solving skills.

### Goal

The main goal of this project was to apply the concepts and lessons I learned about React and Frontend Development in general. Following are three areas of focus that I wanted to improve on:

-   Implementing clean, polished, and responsive user interface
-   Managing color scheme and themes effectively to achieve consistent look and feel of the overall design
-   Practice handling data fetching and setting up API layers in the application

### Tech Stack

##### Platform

-   Netlify
-   Vite
-   React

##### Styling

-   TailwindCSS

##### Data Fetching

-   react-query
-   axios

# Things I've learned

# Installation

1. Install the required node packages for the project using [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

    ```
    yarn add
    ```

2. Once finished, you would need to configure `.env.local` file and add it to the root directory of the project. Within the `.env.local` file, add following code and save it. (make sure that `.gitignore` file ignore any `.env` or `.local` file format)

    ```
    VITE_YOUTUBE_API_BASE_URL=https://youtube.googleapis.com/youtube/v3
    VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY='[Paste your personal Youtube API Key here]'
    ```

    This information required to successfully pull the data from [Youtube Data API](https://www.google.com/search?q=youtube+data+api&oq=youtube+data+api&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyDwgAEEUYORiDARixAxiABDIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIGCAUQRRg8MgYIBhBFGDwyBggHEEUYPNIBCDI5OThqMGoxqAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) endpoints. If you don't have your own youtube api key, follow the instruction [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).

3. Start the project using `yarn dev`.

# TODO

-   [x] Replace deprecated API parameter(`relatedToVideoId`)
    -   As of August 7th, 2023, [Youtube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/revision_history#june-12,-2023) have discontinued their support for `relatedToVideoId` parameter from `search.list` method and it's no longer part of public API. Due to this change, I've redirected API call to retrieve a list of videos from a given channel with `channelId` instead of `relatedToVideoId`.
-   [ ] Add proper loading fallback and 404 page
-   [ ] Fix encoding issues "&#39" on video title
